    <p>Formula One (F1) stands as the pinnacle of motorsport, epitomizing the fusion of
        cutting-edge automotive technology, driver prowess, and strategic team
        management. Since its inception in 1950, the sport has undergone profound
        transformations influenced by technological advancements, regulatory changes,
        and evolving competitive dynamics. In recent years, significant developments
        such as the introduction of hybrid power units in 2014, the implementation of
        budget caps in 2021 to level the competitive field, and adaptations due to
        global events like the COVID-19 pandemic have further reshaped the landscape of
        F1.</p>
    <p>The primary objective of this project is to analyze and visualize the evolution
        of key performance metrics in Formula One (F1) over the period from 1950
        to 2023. By examining metrics such as mean career win rates for drivers and
        points per race for constructors, the project aims to uncover trends, assess the
        impact of regulatory changes, and highlight significant shifts in team and
        driver performances. These visualizations will provide valuable insights for
        fans, analysts, and teams to understand the dynamics that have shaped the sport
        over the decades.</p>

            <li>Mercedes has the best (lowest) mean finishing position in a given season of all time of 3.17 in

            <li>Zakspeed has the worst (highest) mean finishing position in a given season of all time of 35.03 in
                1989. Funnily enough, 1989 was also the last year they participated in F1...
            </li>
            <li>Out of the drivers with at least 20 race starts, Juan Manuel Fangio appears to be the driver with the
                best mean career finishing position of all time with an average finishing place of 4.79. However, it
                must be noted that the next best driver according to this metric is Lewis Hamilton at 4.88, a driver
                with a far greater total number of race starts at 332 compared to Fangio's 58.
            </li>
            <li>Out of the drivers with at least 20 race starts, Bernd Schneider appears to be the driver
                with the worst mean career finishing position of all time with an average finishing place of 28.5.
                Interestingly, he drove for Zakspeed in 1989, the same team that we previously identified as having
                the worst mean finishing position for a constructor in a single year...

    <h2 class="section-heading">F1 Constructors' Performance over time with Regulatory Changes</h2>
    <p>I first wanted to be able to compare and evaluate the performance of F1 constructors across several
        years and seasons. At first, I chose mean points per race per season as the key performance indicator for this
        task. I made this choice to account for the different number of races different seasons could have. I initially
        used a multi-line graph for the task of identifying constructors that outperformed both their competitors and
        their own past performances.</p>
    <p>However, I ran into a few major problems. While the line graph was somewhat effective in identifying the best
        performers, this comparison was not always fair. F1 has modified its system for awarding points several times
        over its history, so comparing the performance of teams in these different eras is a challenge. The graph was
        also prone to feeling cluttered with too much data being displayed at once. Moreover, identifying the worst
        performing teams was essentially impossible as there far too many teams that had scored 0 mean points per
        race over several seasons.</p>
    <figure aria-label="F1 constructors' Performance visualization issue mitigation">
        <figcaption class="fig-heading">How I mitigated issues:-</figcaption>
        <ul>
            <li>I elected to transform my original graph to a streamgraph to better handle the large volume of data.
            </li>
            <li>I created another multi-line graph but this time with a different performance metric: mean finishing
                position per race per season. This new metric was effectively safe from being skewed by any modification
                of the points scoring system and would thus allow for fairer comparisons across different eras. This
                change also made it much easier to identify the worst performing teams.
            </li>
            <li>I implemented the ability to filter by specific constructors and year ranges to allow users to have an
                easier time interactively exploring the data.
            </li>
            <li>I added a toggle to display annotations that would describe any major changes to the technical
                regulations or points system for a given year.
            </li>
            <li>I displayed the distribution statistics for the portion of the data that was currently selected through
                the filters.
            </li>

        <figcaption class="fig-heading">Chart 1 Insights</figcaption>
        <ul>
            <li>Mercedes in 2015 had the highest mean points per race in a given season of all time at 37. This is
                out of a maximum possible score of 43 in a single race at the time. That is roughly 86% of the
                highest possible value for that key performance indicator.
            </li>
            <li>The introduction of V8 engines doubled Ferrari's mean points per race from ~5 in 2005 to ~11 in 2006
                while weakening that same metric for McLaren and Williams.
            </li>
            <li>The points system changes in 2010 severely inflated the amount of points constructors scored in the
                following years compared to the years preceding that rule change.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <figcaption class="fig-heading">Chart 2 Insights</figcaption>
        <ul>
            <li>Mercedes has the best (lowest) mean finishing position in a given season of all time of 3.17 in
                2017. This implies that it would have been a safe gamble to bet that they would be on the podium
                every race. I believe the reason why it is 2017 and not 2015 is because of the two DNFs that Nico
                Rosberg had in 2015 which for this metric hurt more than simply not scoring any points at all.
            </li>
            <li>Zakspeed has the worst (highest) mean finishing position in a given season of all time of 35.03 in
                1989. However, during that season they were officially classified as 2nd last instead of last as one
                would expect. The team that finished below them "EuroBrun" did not manage to qualify for a single
                race. It appears that the chosen performance indicator of mean finishing position for this specific
                dataset punishes DNFs more than simply not taking part in a race. Funnily enough, 1989 was also the last
                year they participated in F1...
            </li>
            <li>Contrary to popular belief, Ferrari's performance in 2020 was not their worst of all time. That
                crown goes to 1992 where there mean finishing position was 14th...

    <h2 class="section-heading">F1 Drivers' Career Winrate</h2>
    <p>Next, I wanted to examine the nationalities and eras of F1 drivers were the most successful. I initially
        chose total career race wins as the success metric here. I started by creating two bar graphs, one that
        displayed the nationalities with the most career race wins and another that displayed the driver cohorts,
        denoted by the decade a driver was born in, with the most career race wins. I had to settle for using birth
        decade here instead of debut decade (when they joined F1) because the dataset I used did not have this
        information present.</p>
    <p>I quickly noticed that the most successful countries were usually the ones with the highest number of total
        combined race starts of their drivers. Therefore, I decided to use mean win rate instead to account for this.
        This is a country's total wins of a country divided by that country's total number of race starts. While
        multiple drivers from the same country can take part in a race, only one can win it. Nevertheless, the number of
        race starts essentially represents the number of opportunities a country has to win a race. I also did the same
        thing with the graph for birth decade. Dividing by the number of drivers would not have made sense as different
        drivers take part in different numbers of races. I also added a filter to remove drivers with less than the
        selected number of race starts from the calculations. This gives users the option to decrease the amount of
        noise and outliers in the data from drivers who may have only participated in a few or just a single race in
        their entire F1 career.</p>

        <figcaption class="fig-heading">Insights</figcaption>
        <ul>
            <li>Britain has the highest number of total wins at 309. Lewis Hamilton is responsible for roughly a
                third of those. This country also has the highest number of race starts so I believe this
                achievement can be attributed to the large size of this category.
            </li>
            <li>The Netherlands has the highest mean career win rate of 10.55%, with Argentina following closely
                behind with a mean career win rate of 10.15%. I believe this is likely due to the efforts of Max
                Verstappen and Juan Manuel Fangio and the possibility that in general there probably haven't been
                too many drivers from these two countries compared to other countries with more total wins like
                Germany and Britain.
            </li>
            <li>The cohort born in the 1980s has the highest total number of wins at 258.
            </li>
            <li>The cohort born in the 1910s has the highest mean career win rate of 7.05%, with the 1980s and 1960s
                following at 6.57% and 5.16%. Interestingly, the three driver champions with highest number of
                titles (Schumacher, Hamilton, Fangio) are each from one of these cohorts.

<div aria-label="Impact of Budget Cap on F1 Constructor Performance"
     id="Impact of Budget Cap on F1 Constructor Performance" class="section">
    <h2 class="section-heading">Impact of Budget Cap on F1 Constructor Performance</h2>
    <p>The next thing I wanted to evaluate was the budget cap that was first instituted in 2021. While originally
        planned to start at $175 million in 2021, the economic impact of COVID-19 reduced this figure to $145 million
        for that year. I wanted to see if the budget cap had been successful in its goal of reducing the gap between the
        top and bottom teams in F1.</p>
    <p>For this task, I chose to use the distribution of mean points per race as the metric for comparison. Two periods
        would be compared, 2018-2020 and 2021-2023. These three-year periods were chosen because the cost cap has only
        been in effect recently since 2021, so I chose to compare the combined three-year points distribution before and
        after the implementation of the budget cap. The choice of mean points per race here is unaffected by any points
        system changes as there haven't been any of those in this time period except for the singular point for the
        fastest lap in a race introduced in 2019 that shouldn't skew results by a noticeable margin.</p>
    <p>An issue that I immediately noticed was that by choosing to aggregrate the results for all teams during these two
        periods, the team-specific changes from this cost cap. Therefore, I decided to make another box plot with the
        constructors that participated during these periods on the x-axis, with the period now being denoted by color
        hue instead.</p>
    <figure class="fig"
            aria-label="Visualization of the impact of the 2021 budget cap on F1 constructor performance">

        <figcaption class="fig-heading">Insights</figcaption>
        <ul>
            <li>When spread out across three years, the budget cap seems to have increased the median points per
                race by 1 but also decreased the lower and upper quartiles by 1. So, in terms of gap in points per
                race the budget cap seems to not have had a meaningful impact. However, while this dataset does not
                have details on qualifying pace gaps, that is one potential area for exploration.
            </li>
            <li>The budget cap does not appear to have been completely effective in reducing the domination of all
                the "top" teams, namely Mercedes, Ferrari, and Red Bull. Mercedes and Ferrari did experience a drop
                in means points per race after the introduction of the budget, but Red Bull surged ahead in the same
                comparison. Coincidentally, there was a major technical regulation change in aerodynamics in 2022.
                This implies that technical regulations play a more impactful role in affecting the mean points per
                race of constructors than the budget cap has so far. This obviously has the potential to change for
                future seasons.

    <p>Another key performance indicator I wanted to examine was the consistency of a constructor throughout a given
        season in relation to their competition. I would define this metric as the interquartile range (75th Percentile
        - 25th Percentile) of the points that a given constructor scored per race during the selected season. I chose to
        use box plots once again to visualize this metric. To allow for interactive exploration across the widest range

    <h2 class="section-heading">F1 Driver Title Contributions</h2>
    <p>In recent times, we have heard that some teams prioritize the driver's title over the constructors as it may be
        more 'marketable'. So, I wanted to find out the extent to which F1 driver champions were responsible for the
        success of the teams they drove for. I decided that a Sankey Diagram was the appropriate idiom to use for this
        task.</p>
    <p>However, I ran into a problem. The same constructor in some cases had raced under different names in the past so
        they were recorded as different constructors in the dataset. Brabham and Lotus were the biggest offenders in
        this case. I had to address this by programmatically identifying these 'duplicates' and merging them together
        during the data processing.</p>
    <p>I also decided to implement filters, so that users would have the interactive freedom to explore multiple-time
        champions or drivers who won with many teams vs just a single one.</p>

            </li>
            <li>McLaren has the largest number of WDCs from drivers who went on to win more than one title in their
                career.
            </li>
            <li>McLaren and Ferrari both share the top spot for having the highest number of drivers (3) that have
                won with them more than once.
            </li>
            <li>Williams and Alfa Romeo are the only teams with multiple WDCs to not have a single driver that has
                won more than a single title with them. Of these, Williams has the highest number (7).

    <h2 class="section-heading">Mean Finishing Position of F1 Drivers by Country</h2>
    <p>Coming back to the topic of nationalities, I wanted to reexamine country-specific performance using the mean
        finishing position metric instead of just race wins. To achieve this, I opted to display the data on a
        choropleth map which I believed would make identifying both extremes of the spectrum easier.</p>
    <p>I quickly noticed a peculiar problem. The best performing country ended up being the country with just a single
        driver that had participated in F1... To account for this possibly anomalous result, I added filters that
        allow users to disregard countries with less than the chosen minimum number of drivers and also drivers with
        less than the chosen minimum number of race starts. I also implemented the ability to pan across or zoom into
        the map to allow users to focus on specific regions with lots of countries packed in a smaller area, such as
        Europe.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>At first glance, Poland seems to have the best mean finishing position at 10.65 over 99 races.
                However, this is due to the fact they have only ever had a single driver compete under their flag,
                Robert Kubica, who appears to have been a great performer relative to the average F1 driver
                throughout the sport's history. Raising the minimum races per driver to 5 or 10 does not change this
                fact as Kubica has taken part in several seasons worth of F1 races.
            </li>
            <li>Raising both the minimum number of drivers and minimum races per driver to 5 makes Mexico stand out
                with a mean finishing position of 13.01 across 6 drivers over 444 races. I believe that Sergio Perez
                is largely responsible for this as he is the most successful Mexican driver in F1 history.
            </li>
            <li>Raising both the minimum number of drivers and minimum races per driver to 10 highlights Argentina
                as the most successful with a mean finishing position of 12.81 across 10 drivers over 343 races. I
                suspect that Juan Manuel Fangio's era of domination is the likely culprit behind this stat.
            </li>
            <li>There are only 5 countries in the whole world who have had at least 20 drivers drive at least 20
                races each in F1: Brazil, Germany, Italy, France, and the United Kingdom. Out of this, the UK
                appears to have the best mean finishing position of 12.49 across 42 drivers over 3814 races. This
                doesn't feel like a surprise, given that the UK has historically produced the highest number of F1
                drivers' champions. However, it does show that at this point in time F1 has overall still been
                largely historically populated by European drivers.

    <h2 class="section-heading">Mean Career Finishing Position of F1 Drivers</h2>
    <p>Finally, I wanted to address what I believe is one of the most divisive questions that has a stranglehold on the
        sport: who is the greatest F1 driver of all time? As we have seen previously, points are not an effective metric
        for answering questions like this due to the numerous changes in the points system throughout F1 history. While
        the number of drivers' championships a driver has earned might be a simpler popular alternative, what do you do
        if two drivers have the same number of titles? Therefore, I wanted to employ the mean career finishing position
        metric to answer this question. I chose to compare mean career finishing position to total career races. For the
        choice of visualization idiom, I elected to utilize a scatter plot for this task as I believe that this is
        likely the best way to handle the very large size of the data (755 drivers).</p>
    <p>I instantly identified an odd issue. The driver that was the best according to the chosen metric was one who had
        only driven a single F1 race in their entire career... To mitigate this oddity, I added the ability to filter
        out drivers who had less than the selected number of race starts to reduce the amount of noise and anomalies in
        the data. I also implemented filtering by nationalities to allow users the interactive freedom to explore the
        best (or worst) drivers from any country of their choosing. Finally, I displayed the distribution statistics for
        the portion of the data that was currently selected through the filters.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>At first glance, Dorino Serafini appears to be the driver with the best mean career finishing
                position of all time with an average finish of 2nd place... However, this driver has only driven a
                single F1 race in their entire career. If we filter out everyone with less than 20 race starts, Juan
                Manuel Fangio appears to be the driver with the best mean career finishing position of all time with
                an average finishing place of 4.79. However, it must be noted that the next best driver according to
                this metric is Lewis Hamilton at 4.88, a driver with a far greater total number of race starts at
                332 compared to Fangio's 58.
            </li>
            <li>On the surface, Enrico Bertaggia appears to be the driver with the worst mean career finishing
                position of all time of 38.83. Keep in mind that 39 is the worst possible finishing position
                possible in the dataset... However, this driver has only driven 6 F1 races in their entire career.
                If we filter out everyone with less than 20 race starts, Bernd Schneider appears to be the driver
                with the worst mean career finishing position of all time with an average finishing place of 28.5.
                Interestingly, he drove for Zakspeed in 1989, the same team that we previously identified as having
                the worst mean finishing position for a constructor in a single year...
